    "\n",
    "We will work with statistics on Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet. We will use game_log.csv as our main file along with three helper files: park_codes.csv, person_codes.csv, and team_codes.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step will be to perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get familiar with the data. We want to create a normalized database, so our focus will be on becoming familiar with the meaning of each column in each file and thinking about the relationships between the columns within each file and across different files.\n",
